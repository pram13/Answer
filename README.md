I am using VSCO to code and this is the only question i can answer cause i thought it will be the very basic ones but it's quite difficult for beginner like me to answer those whole questions properly, and i think it's kinda like the advance skill code level. i will try again next time on the next chances if it's still available. thanks a lot Arkademy for giving me the opportunity.
